# Mood-driven Melodies
This is a website that I made with the inspiration of always wanting to find new songs for a certain mood im feeling, but only finding generic playlists never getting it right. It uses Google Cloud's API to suggest songs based on user input of mood and uses Spotify's api to get the cover art of that song. Another feature allows you to log in to your Spotify account and view your top artists and top tracks. At the moment, my project is in "development mode" on Spotify, so only users I have added as testers on my dashboard are allowed to view their stats, so if you'd like to test out the app please reach out to me and ill add you onto it!
